C Regular Expressions Engine

This is a regular expressions engine written from scratch in C language. 

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. More information on regular expressions can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression

The engine currently supports:

  1- Literals  <i>Ex: abc123.</i>
  
  2- Sets  <i>Ex: [abc]</i>
  
  3- Star/plus/question mark  <i>Ex: a*b?c+</i>
  
  4- Alternates  <i>Ex: (a|b)</i>
  
  5- Start and end  <i>Ex: ^abc$</i>
  
  6- Escape sequences  <i>Ex: \a \d</i>
