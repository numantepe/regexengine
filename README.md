C Regular Expressions Engine

This is a regular expressions engine written from scratch in C language. 

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. More information on regular expressions can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression

The engine currently supports:

  1- Literals:  <i>abc123.</i>
  
  2- Sets:  <i>[abc]</i>
  
  3- Star/plus/question mark:  <i>a*b?c+</i>
  
  4- Alternates:  <i>(foo|bar)</i>
  
  5- Start and end:  <i>^abc$</i>
  
  6- Escape sequences:  <i>\a \d</i>
